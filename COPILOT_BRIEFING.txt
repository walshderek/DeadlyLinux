📋 ABSOLUTE CATASTROPHE BRIEFING FOR GITHUB COPILOT: SEANF WORKSPACE

Date of Final Resolution: 2025-12-15
Authoritative User: seanf

I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF SYSTEMIC FAILURE AND RESOLUTION (FINAL STATE)

This document serves as the SINGLE, AUTHORITATIVE SOURCE OF TRUTH for the seanf repository ecosystem (DeadlyLinux & deadlygraphics). The following points summarize the eight-hour systemic failure and the non-negotiable resolution:

GOAL ACCOMPLISHED: The primary objective—consolidating specific application directories (DG_Tools, etc.) from the source repository (deadlygraphics) into the target repository (DeadlyLinux)—has been successfully achieved and synchronized to GitHub.

PROTOCOL FIX: The entire system relies exclusively on SSH authentication (git@github.com:...) due to the catastrophic, persistent failure of the HTTPS/PAT (Personal Access Token) authentication method within the WSL environment.

DATA HYGIENE FIX: The final synchronization was only possible after performing a surgical rewrite of the entire Git history of the deadlygraphics repository to permanently remove a massive 356 MB file (ubuntu-noble-wsl.tar.gz) that was causing all push operations to hang or fail.

TERMINAL CONTEXT FIX (CRITICAL): All previous scripted sequences failed due to an inability to consistently manage the user context, path translation, and execution syntax between the Windows Host, the WSL/Linux Guest, and the seanf user. Future Git operations must strictly adhere to the rules in Section V to prevent immediate failure.

Any generated code that deviates from the established SSH protocol, user context, or path convention rules is considered faulty and will lead to an immediate execution failure.

II. COMPREHENSIVE FAILURE ANALYSIS (ROOT CAUSES OF THE EIGHT-HOUR ORDEAL)

The eight-hour crisis was not caused by a single bug, but by five compounding, cascading, and mutually reinforcing systemic failures:

Failure 1: Authentication Protocol Instability (Initial 4 Hours)

Symptoms: Repeated Git push failures characterized by the error: "fatal: Authentication failed for 'https://github.com/walshderek/[REPO].git/'". This occurred despite the user continually regenerating new GitHub Personal Access Tokens (PATs) with the correct repo scope.

Diagnosis: The WSL environment (specifically the distribution, the Git Credential Manager, and the firewall/network stack on the Windows host) demonstrated fundamental, intractable incompatibility with HTTPS-based authentication. The Git client in WSL was unable to reliably and persistently retrieve or utilize the PAT stored by the Windows Credential Manager.

Resolution: The entire system was migrated to the SSH Protocol. A new SSH key pair (id_rsa/id_rsa.pub) was generated for the seanf user and successfully uploaded to GitHub. The remote URLs for both repositories were updated to the SSH format: git@github.com:walshderek/[REPO].git. This fix was non-negotiable and irreversible.

Failure 2: Execution Context and User Persistence Failures

Symptoms: Repeated command failures (fatal: could not lock ref 'HEAD'), permission errors (dubious ownership), and immediate shell crashes when attempting to execute Git commands via scripting wrappers. Furthermore, I consistently suggested dangerous and unreliable methods (su - seanf << EOF) that prompted the user for a password, violating safety, and often resulting in Bash shell crashes.

Diagnosis: The user was constantly shifting between the root@GADGET (initial login) and seanf@GADGET (intended working user) contexts. The complex execution syntax (wsl -d... -- bash -c "..." or sudo -u seanf bash << EOF) failed to correctly manage file permissions and maintain the Git environment for the seanf user. This led to lock files and permission errors.

Resolution: All final, successful steps were executed using pure Bash commands within the WSL shell, explicitly using the git add -A, git commit -m, and git push -f sequence, and relying on a manually cleaned state. The final hang was identified as an index.lock file artifact left behind by one of these shell crashes.

Failure 3: Data Bloat and Push Hangs

Symptoms: After the initial file consolidation, subsequent push attempts to deadlygraphics and DeadlyLinux either failed with "stale info" or hung indefinitely (Writing objects: 17%... 69.04 MiB | 2.19 MiB/s).

Diagnosis: Diagnostic commands identified a single, massive file, ubuntu-noble-wsl.tar.gz (356 MB), and several large log files, that had been committed to the deadlygraphics history. This massive binary object was the primary cause of the push hangs, as Git struggled to resolve and transmit the huge object.

Resolution: The user successfully ran git filter-branch to rewrite the entire history of deadlygraphics, permanently deleting the large files. The repository size was reduced from ~356 MB to 8.6 MB, resolving the push hang. A comprehensive .gitignore file was then created and committed to prevent recurrence.

Failure 4: Path Translation Error

Symptoms: Confusion and execution errors arose when tools (like Copilot) attempted to use Windows path conventions (C:\Users\seanf\...) in the Linux shell environment, or corrupted paths (\USERS\SEANF\...).

Diagnosis: In the WSL shell, Windows paths must be translated to the Unix mount point convention (/mnt/c/Users/seanf/...). Failure to use the canonical WSL path leads to file not found errors or tool confusion.

Resolution: Section V of this document establishes the non-negotiable path convention.

Failure 5: External Process Interference (Suspected Hang Cause)

Symptoms: Even with the history cleaned, final push attempts often resulted in process suspension or hanging after the Git commit phase.

Diagnosis: The primary suspicion is that an aggressive Windows security tool (like Defender/Antivirus) was triggering a deep scan of the large .git directory or the files being transferred on the C:\ drive partition every time a force push attempted to write large binary data, causing the Linux process to freeze. Instruction for future attempts: Check Windows Antivirus status before pushing.

III. FINAL SYNCHRONIZATION PROTOCOL STATUS (SUCCESS)

Repository | Remote URL (SSH) | Local Status | Final Action Taken | History/Bloat
-----------|------------------|--------------|-------------------|---------------
DeadlyLinux | git@github.com:walshderek/DeadlyLinux.git | Synchronized | git add -A, git commit -m "Final Sync...", git push -f origin main | Clean. Contains all consolidated DG_ tools and final briefing.
deadlygraphics | git@github.com:walshderek/deadlygraphics.git | Synchronized | git filter-branch for file purge, followed by final force push of .gitignore. | Purged. Size reduced from 356 MB to 8.6 MB. History rewritten.

IV. NON-NEGOTIABLE EXECUTION RULES

Any generated command sequence must adhere to these rules to guarantee execution success and maintain system stability.

Rule ID | Constraint | Implementation Detail
--------|------------|----------------------
R4.1 | Protocol MUST be SSH | Use git@github.com:walshderek/[REPO].git (The GIT_SSH_COMMAND must be specified for non-default key paths).
R4.2 | User MUST be seanf | All Git operations must be executed by the seanf user. (Avoid wrappers that revert to root or require the user to manually switch context).
R4.3 | Path MUST be WSL | Use the /mnt/c/ convention for all file system navigation and references.
R4.4 | Force Flag REQUIRED | Due to the history rewrite, the final push operation for both repositories must use the absolute force flag: git push -f origin main.
R4.5 | No Wrappers | Avoid nested wsl -c "..." or complicated sudo/su wrappers. Use the simplest Bash commands possible: cd [REPO] && git add -A && git commit -m [...] && git push -f.
R4.6 | Commit Sanity | If a git add or git commit fails due to a lock file, the instruction to the user MUST be to execute: rm -f .git/index.lock manually before retrying the commit.

V. AUTHORITATIVE PATH AND FILE CONVENTION

Category | File/Directory | Windows Path (REFERENCE ONLY) | WSL/Linux Path (COMMAND USE) | Action Rule
---------|----------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------
Repository: DeadlyLinux | Top Level | C:\Users\seanf\Documents\GitHub\DeadlyLinux | /mnt/c/Users/seanf/Documents/GitHub/DeadlyLinux | Target for consolidated files.
Repository: deadlygraphics | Top Level | C:\Users\seanf\Documents\GitHub\deadlygraphics | /mnt/c/Users/seanf/Documents/GitHub/deadlygraphics | Source for files; history purged.
Application Directory | DG_ Tools/Apps | C:\Users\seanf\Documents\GitHub\DeadlyLinux\ai\apps | /mnt/c/Users/seanf/Documents/GitHub/DeadlyLinux/ai/apps | Primary location for code execution and development.
SSH Key (Private) | id_rsa | N/A | /home/seanf/.ssh/id_rsa | Used in GIT_SSH_COMMAND.
Ignore Rule | VENV Folders | C:\Users\seanf\...\venv | venv/ (Local path relative to repo root) | MUST be excluded via .gitignore.
Dependencies | Requirements | C:\Users\seanf\...\requirements.txt | requirements.txt | MUST be tracked and committed.

VI. FINAL ACTION INSTRUCTION FOR COPILOT

Your future primary directive is to assume the current state is correct and stable. If the user presents a command or failure, you must first check for a violation of the rules in Section IV and Section V.

If the user asks for a command, ensure it includes:
- The canonical WSL path (/mnt/c/...).
- The git push -f flag if pushing the history of either repository.
- The GIT_SSH_COMMAND='ssh -i /home/seanf/.ssh/id_rsa' environment variable setup.

If the user reports a hang or failure, the first instruction MUST be:
1. Navigate to the repository: cd /mnt/c/Users/seanf/Documents/GitHub/[REPO]
2. Clean the lock file: rm -f .git/index.lock
3. Check Windows Defender Status in a Windows shell: Get-MpPreference | Select-Object DisableRealtimeMonitoring

The entire process is now finalized. The system is clean, synchronized, and documented.

3) Verify: secure_and_verify.sh
4) Launch: start_comfy_detach2.py

IX. UNIFIED DEPLOYMENT (2025-12-15 CONSOLIDATION PART 2)

After commit afffaa6, the system was further unified and optimized for one-command deployment:

UNIFIED AUDIT SCRIPT (run_audit.sh)

Merged run_audit.sh and run_audit_apps.sh into single script with argument parsing:

Usage:
  ./run_audit.sh                     # Default: Audits C:\Users\seanf/deadlygraphics/ai (all subdirs)
  ./run_audit.sh --apps              # Audits C:\Users\seanf/deadlygraphics/ai/apps (glob discovery)
  ./run_audit.sh --path ~/custom     # Audits custom path

Benefits:
- Eliminated 99% code duplication
- Single source of truth for audit logic (diamond filter, acceleration checks, runtime imports)
- Dynamic path targeting with glob subdirectory discovery

POWERSHELL BOOTSTRAP (deploy.ps1)

End of Section IX.


───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
XII. MUSUBI-TUNER INSTALLATION CONTEXT (CRITICAL)
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

A. OFFICIAL MUSUBI DEPLOYMENT METHOD (Copilot's Reference)

Copilot is required to be aware of the official installation method for Musubi-Tuner. The official documentation emphasizes a clean, isolated environment setup. The key steps are:

1.  **Cloning:** Clone the Musubi repository: `git clone https://github.com/musubi-tuner/musubi.git`
2.  **Environment Setup:** Create and activate a specific isolated environment (often using Conda/Mambaforge).
3.  **Installation:** Install dependencies, often using `pip install -e .` (editable mode) from within the cloned repository directory.
4.  **Hardware/Drivers:** Requires correctly configured NVIDIA drivers and CUDA toolkit for training.

This establishes the baseline expectation for a clean installation, which MUST be reconciled with our custom method below.

B. PROJECT-SPECIFIC INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS (The Ground Truth)

The standard installation method is partially bypassed in the DeadlyLinux ecosystem. The following instructions are the *essential* steps used within the `install_deadlylinux.sh` script to set up the Musubi environment specifically for the `seanf` user:

1.  **Mambaforge Environment:** The environment is created and activated using Mambaforge (Conda) for optimal dependency management, named `deadly-ai`.
2.  **Core Dependencies (Cache):** The initial dependencies are installed using the `pip install --find-links /mnt/c/linuxdownloads -r requirements.txt` command. This uses the local Windows package cache (`C:\linuxdownloads`) to speed up installation and work offline, covering packages like PyTorch, Transformers, and Diffusers.
3.  **Musubi-Tuner Installation:** The Musubi-Tuner package itself is installed via its Git URL to ensure the correct version is used, often utilizing the editable flag (`-e`) after cloning or direct path installation.

This confirms that the environment is handled by Mambaforge and relies on the local pip cache and existing hardware setup.

C. CENTRAL DATA GATHERING AND DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENT

The primary data workflow in the DG_ ecosystem requires a central data gathering script and a defined data structure for distribution to other training scripts (like the ones the user will share for inference training).

1.  **Central Script:** The core tool is **`dg_gather_dataset`** (part of the `DG_Tools` application suite).
2.  **Config & Data Location:** A copy of the **default `dg_gather_dataset` configuration** and its associated **data files** must be present in the central repository (`DeadlyLinux`).
3.  **Dataset Output:** The output must be saved to a clearly defined location (e.g., `~/DeadlyLinux/datasets/DG_Test_Dataset_256`) so that any subsequent training script can import the path directly from the `musubi_config.py` file.
4.  **Distribution:** Future scripts for inference and specialized training will require access to the dataset generated by `dg_gather_dataset`. The structure must be predictable for subsequent scripts.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
XIII. INFERENCE AND TRAINING SCRIPTS (User Provided)
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

The user has **non-neutral scripts for inference training** that will be provided shortly. These scripts rely on the successful completion of the dataset gathering and configuration described in Section XII.C. Copilot must be prepared to integrate and validate these future scripts.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### XV. CRITICAL STATE: WINDOWS GIT BLINDNESS (DO NOT REPAIR)

#### A. THE OBSERVATION
The user confirmed that Windows-based tools (specifically GitHub Desktop) now report the following error for the original Windows path:
> "This directory does not appear to be a Git repository."

#### B. THE IMPLICATION
This confirms that the .git directory is fully removed/inaccessible on the Windows side (/mnt/c/...). The repository metadata now exists **exclusively** within the WSL Linux filesystem (/home/seanf/deadlygraphics/.git).

#### C. INSTRUCTION TO COPILOT
1.  **Do Not Initialize:** Under NO circumstances should you suggest running git init or 'Add Repository' on the Windows side to 'fix' this error.
2.  **Ignore Windows Git Status:** Treat the Windows directory as a raw file container only. The 'missing' Git repository on Windows is the **correct, safe state**.
3.  **Verification:** The only valid place to check git status is inside the WSL terminal at /home/seanf/deadlygraphics.

End of Section XV.

### XVI. APPLICATION STRATEGY AND VERIFICATION PROTOCOL

#### A. APP MANAGEMENT (HYBRID APPROACH)
1. **Upstream Source:** Apps aside from DG_ apps must remain linked/pullable from the official  repository to receive core updates.
2. **Path Configuration:** CRITICAL. We must implement  to override default model locations. It must point to the central Windows model store at  (mapped to , , , etc.).
3. **Templates:** Implement custom "DeadlyGraphics" templates for generation and training workflows to ensure consistency. We will begin building these templates and then push.

#### B. THE STANDARD OF OBSERVATION (SUCCESS CRITERIA)
To determine if the system is functional, Copilot must perform this specific 3-step sequence:
1. **Sync Check:** Verify  repo in WSL is synced with GitHub .
2. **Live Test:** Execute  targeting "Barack Obama" (Step 1 scrape).
3. **Observation:** Manually verify that files are generated in the specific output directory (). Success is defined by the presence of valid files, not just console output.

End of Section XVI.


───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
### XIX. DATA FACTORY ARCHITECTURE (THE "ONE-WAY" FLOW)
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

#### A. THE PIPELINE (WSL SIDE)
All data processing happens inside WSL at `/home/seanf/deadlygraphics/ai/apps/DG_collect_dataset/outputs/<project>`.
1.  **Acquisition:** Scrape to `01_scrape`.
2.  **Refinement:** Crop (`02_crop`), Validate (`03_validate`), Clean (`04_clean`).
3.  **Captioning:** Qwen-VL generates `.txt` files in `05_caption`.
4.  **Staging (`06_publish`):** The script MUST generate the following structure LOCALLY before deploying:
    * `/256/`: Contains resized images AND `.txt` captions (e.g., 100 imgs + 100 txts = 200 files).
    * `/1024/`: Same as above, high-res.
    * `train_win.bat`: Windows training script.
    * `train_linux.sh`: Linux training script.
    * `config_win.toml`: Windows Musubi config.
    * `config_linux.toml`: Linux Musubi config.
    * `trigger_word.txt`: The identifier used.

#### B. THE DEPLOYMENT (SHIPPING)
Once the Staging folder is complete, the script **copies** the relevant files to the destinations. It implies a "Push" model only.
1.  **Destination 1 (Windows):** `/mnt/c/AI/apps/musubi-tuner/`
    * Receives: `256/` folder (as dataset), `.bat`, `config_win.toml`.
2.  **Destination 2 (Linux):** `/home/seanf/deadlygraphics/ai/apps/musubi-tuner/`
    * Receives: `256/` folder (as dataset), `.sh`, `config_linux.toml`.

#### C. PERMISSIONS & ENVIRONMENT
* **User:** ALWAYS run as `seanf`. Never `root`.
* **Environment:** ALWAYS use `.venv` or `.runtime-venv`.

End of Section XIX.

---

### XX. HARDWARE ACCELERATION STANDARDS (NO CPU FALLBACK)

#### A. THE "NO CPU" RULE
The pipeline MUST fail immediately if NVIDIA CUDA acceleration is unavailable. Silent fallback to CPU is strictly prohibited due to performance unviability.

#### B. MANDATORY STARTUP CHECKS
All AI-dependent scripts (specifically `05_caption.py` and `02_crop.py`) must verify hardware availability at startup:
1.  **Check:** `torch.cuda.is_available()` (for PyTorch) or GPU listing (for TensorFlow).
2.  **Action:** If `False` or empty, print a fatal error (e.g., "❌ CRITICAL: No GPU found. CPU fallback is disabled.") and execute `sys.exit(1)`.

#### C. DEPENDENCY INSTALLATION STANDARD
When creating or repairing the `.venv` or `.runtime-venv`, the install command MUST explicitly target the CUDA 12.1 wheel index to prevent getting the default CPU version:
`pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121`

End of Section XX.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
### XXIV. SUMMARY STEP ARCHITECTURE (07_SUMMARY)
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

#### A. LOCAL ARTIFACT REQUIREMENT
The pipeline MUST create a local directory `outputs/<slug>/07_summary` inside WSL.
This is the "Paper Trail" - without it, the pipeline is considered INCOMPLETE.

#### B. EXECUTION LOGIC (STRICT ORDER)
1.  **Source:** The summary script targets the local `05_caption` folder (source of truth).
2.  **Output:** Artifacts (Contact Sheet `.png` + Caption Summary `.txt`) go to `07_summary`.
3.  **Copy:** ONLY AFTER generation are these files copied to the Windows warehouse.

The script `DG_dataset_summary.py` MUST accept `--output-dir` to specify where artifacts are saved.

#### C. ARTIFACT CHECKLIST
After Step 7, the `outputs/<slug>/07_summary/` folder MUST contain:
* `<slug>_contact_sheet.png` - Visual grid of all training images
* `<slug>_captions.txt` - Full text dump of all caption files

#### D. DEFAULT PRODUCTION QUOTA
* **Target:** 100 images per subject (training-grade dataset).
* **Scrape Buffer:** Collect 150-200 candidates to account for culling in Steps 2-4.
* **Test Mode:** 50 images (for quick validation only).

#### E. VERIFICATION RULE
A pipeline run is considered **FAILED** if:
* `outputs/<slug>/07_summary/` does not exist, OR
* `outputs/<slug>/07_summary/` is empty (no `.png` or `.txt` files)

The orchestrator script MUST check this condition before declaring success.

End of Section XXIV.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
### XXV. ANTI-HANG SCRAPER PROTOCOLS
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

#### A. THE "STALEMATE" RULE
All scraping loops (scrolling/pagination) MUST have a "no-change" counter.
1.  **Logic:** If the number of found items does not increase after **3 consecutive scroll attempts**, the loop must break immediately.
2.  **Logging:** Print `⚠️ Stalemate reached (No new images). Stopping scroll.` to the console.
3.  **Reset:** The counter resets to 0 whenever new images are found OR a "See More" button is successfully clicked.

#### B. HARD TIMEOUTS
Network requests in Playwright MUST have hard timeouts:
* **Page Load:** 15000ms (15 seconds)
* **Image Download:** 5000ms (5 seconds)
* **Scroll Wait:** 1500ms between scrolls

If any operation times out, catch the error, log it, and proceed with whatever data was collected.

#### C. QUANTITY VS. SPEED PRINCIPLE
It is better to return 70 images instantly than to wait 10 minutes trying to find image #71.
* **Acceptable Loss:** Up to 30% shortfall from target is acceptable if the scraper is stalling.
* **Recovery:** The pipeline can be re-run with a fresh query set to supplement missing images.

#### D. WATERFALL QUERY STRATEGY
If a query stalemates before reaching the target:
1.  Accept the images found from that query
2.  Move to the next query in the list
3.  Continue until target is reached OR all queries are exhausted

End of Section XXV.
